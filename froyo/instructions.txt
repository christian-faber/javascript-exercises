Build your website according to this user story:

A visitor receives a prompt upon opening the website to enter a list of comma-separated froyo flavors.
They type vanilla,vanilla,vanilla,strawberry,coffee,coffee.
When they view the browser console, they observe a table listing how many of each flavor they have ordered.
In this case, they will be able to observe that they have ordered three vanilla, two coffee, and one strawberry froyo.

e.g
vanilla: 3
strawberry: 1
coffee: 1

Hints
If you are feeling stuck, try answering the following questions:

1) Is the HTML file connected to the JS file?
2) Can you prompt the user for froyo flavors and store their result?
3) Can you parse the user input into an array of froyo flavors?
4) Can you build an object to track which flavors you have observed so far?
5) As you iterate through the array of flavors, when should that object be updated?
6) Is your logic organized into a function?
